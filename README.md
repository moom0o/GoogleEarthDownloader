**Quality** - Set your quality, higher number will mean images are more zoomed in, thus using much more space. Math problem for amount of images is (quality^2)(quality^2)=number of 256x256 images. For example, using quality 3, you will have 81 256x256 pixel images total. (3^2)*(3^2)=81

The other options are currently not implemented yet, and may never be. They were intended to be used if you only want a certain section of the world.
